 Fetch the StudyParticipant record from cache if caching is turned on, otherwise from the Bridge API. 
 
 Note that if BridgeSDK was initialized with caching, the StudyParticipant record will always exist in the cache
 once the client has signed in for the first time, and since StudyParticipant is client-updatable, the cached copy
 would take priority over whatever Bridge responded with, so with caching turned on, this method will never try to
 retrieve the StudyParticipant from Bridge.
 
 Note also that the UserSessionInfo object received from Bridge on signIn is a superset of StudyParticipant, and
 upon successful signIn, any existing StudyParticipant object is deleted from cache and re-created from the
 UserSessionInfo. If any changes are made to the StudyParticipant on the Bridge server that didn't come from this
 client, the client's sessionToken should be invalidated, forcing the client to sign back in and thus update its
 cached StudyParticipant from the server.

 This method writes a StudyParticipant record consisting of just the dataGroups field to the Bridge server.
 You may set the dataGroups directly as part of the StudyParticipant record when signing up for a Bridge account,
 but afterward should always update them via this method or one of the convenience methods that calls it
 (see note below about cached scheduled activities).
 
 @note If using caching, be aware that calling this method (or any of the convenience methods which call it) will remove unexpired, unfinished scheduled activities from the cache. The next call to get scheduled activities will replace them with the correct schedule going forward for the new set of data groups. If you're not using the SDK's built-in caching, you will need to take care of this yourself.
